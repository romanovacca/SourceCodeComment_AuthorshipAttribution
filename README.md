Thesis application made as a thesisproject for the Bachelor Information Science at the VU University in Amsterdam.

The application is inspired by the following blog for authorship attribution based on poets: http://www.aicbt.com/authorship-attribution/ 


"test_sets_scripts" and "train_scripts" contain text files which consist of code of Kaggle users have posted on www.Kaggle.com
"Romano_Vacca_Thesis.pdf" explains how I worked throughout the whole project.
"Source_code_authorship_attribution.py" contains all the code for the whole project.

If you have any questions regarding this application, please send me a question at "romanovacca@gmail.com"
